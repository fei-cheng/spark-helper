# YARN Client Mode Example
# ------------------------
# The --archives option places our packaged up environment on each
# YARN worker's lookup path with an alias that we define. The pattern
# is `local-file-name#aliased-file-name`. So when we set
# PYSPARK_PYTHON to `venv/bin/python`, `venv/` here references the
# aliased zip file we're sending to YARN.

# YARN Cluster Mode Example
# -------------------------
# Two additional tips when running in cluster mode:
#  1. Be sure not to name your driver script (in this example, hello.py)
#     the same name as your application folder. This confuses Python when it
#     tries to import your module (e.g. `import application`).
#  2. Since your driver is running on the cluster, you'll need to
#     replicate any environment variables you need using
#     `--conf "spark.yarn.appMasterEnv..."` and any local files you
#     depend on using `--files`.
